# Tuples
# Similar to arrays in Java
# They have indexes and sequential as lists
# It can not be changed after being created.
#   We can not add or remove elements
#   We can not change an element
# We can prefer "tuples" for a list of stables.
#   This will increase the stability
#   And this will be better in terms of performance

# () is used for tuples
tupleVowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
